							Rebecca is a great therapist; she really made me feel at ease straight away and is very knowledgeable in what she does. My complaint of upper back pain was gone after a couple of treatments and I now feel fantastic. I will definitely be returning regularly to prevent any future back pain! Thanks!

							I have been treated by Rebecca for over 2 years and I highly recommend her services. Her first-rate treatment and advice has enabled me to carry on with my work and maintain a good physical wellbeing. Rebecca treats a variety of individuals and does not just cater for athletes and sports people, she helps those general day to day aches and pains too. As a therapist she is confident in what she does, fun and always eager to give some useful advice.

							I am an amateur marathon runner and often feel shattered due to my long training runs. Rebecca treating me regularly has definitely kept my body (and mind!) on track to finishing the 26 miles and helped keep me injury free. Her nutritional advice has also helped me to not reach the dreaded wall and keep going to the end!

							I met Rebecca through athletics where we trained and competed together, relying on each other for support. Following my transition to becoming a competitive triathlete I now rely on her totally for support &ndash; to fix all the aches and niggles I get&hellip; and I wouldn&rsquo;t see anyone else! We have a laugh and I feel totally confident in her ability to diagnose my problem and then help fix it! I definitely recommend Rebecca as a therapist for any problem.
